                                                                               MATHS - 2 


(1) Check if a Number is armstrong or not. ?
👉 Short Definition:
A number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of each of its digits raised to the power of total digits equals the number itself.
Example: Let’s take 153
                  → It has 3 digits                 
                  → So we do:  1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
🌟 Properties of ArmStrong number :
                   - All single-digit numbers (0–9) are Armstrong numbers.
                       👉 Because for example: 5 = 5¹ ✅
                   - Permutations of an Armstrong number are not always Armstrong
                       ❌ (e.g., 153 is Armstrong but 531 is not!)
                   - Armstrong numbers are not always palindromes.
                     ❌ For example, 153 ≠ 351 , Only a few are plindrome also (like 1, 0, to 9.).
                   - The sum of two Armstrong numbers is usually not an Armstrong number.
                     ❌ For example, 153 + 370 = 523,   5^3+2^3+3^3 =125+8+27 =160 !=523
Step-by-Step Logic to Check Armstrong Number :
                                - Take a number → e.g. 153
                                - Count how many digits it has → 3
                                - Extract each digit one by one
                                - Raise each digit to the power of total digits
                                - Add them together
                                - Compare the sum with the original number
                                                                 - If equal → ✅ Armstrong
                                                                 - Else → ❌ Not Armstrong


(2) check if a number is palindrome ?
👉 Short Definition:
A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
Example :
        121 → reverse is 121 → same → Palindrome  
        123 → reverse is 321 → not same → Not Palindrome
🌟 Properties of Palindrome Numbers :
      - All single-digit numbers (0–9) are palindromes.
                👉 Because reversing them gives the same number.
      - A palindrome number reads the same both ways.
                Example: 1221 → same from left and right.
      - Palindromes can also appear in strings (like “madam”, “level”) — not only in numbers.
Step-by-Step Logic to Check Palindrome Number :
Let’s take an example → 121
Step 1️⃣
  - Take the number and store it → original_num = 121
Step 2️⃣
  - Initialize reversed_num = 0
Step 3️⃣
    - Extract the last digit using num % 10
                       → Add it to reversed_num after multiplying by 10
                       → Remove the last digit from num using num = num / 10
Step 4️⃣
    - Repeat this until the number becomes 0.
Step 5️⃣
    - Compare:
             if (original_num == reversed_num)
            ✅ Palindrome
            else
            ❌ Not Palindrome


Q3. print all divisors of a number ?
A divisor of a number n is any number that divides n completely (without leaving a remainder).
Example:
6 → divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6
12 → divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
36 → divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
Step-by-Step Logic to Print All Divisors :
Let's take an example → 36
Step 1️⃣
   - Take the number → num = 36
Step 2️⃣
   - use for loop from i=1 to i<=sqrt(num);
 Step 3️⃣
   - check divisor like if(num % i ==0 ) then print i and other num like num/i also print if (i != num/i) sop(num/i).


Q4. Check if a Number is prime or not ?
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself.
Properties of Prime Numbers:
   - Greater than 1:
          - Prime numbers are always greater than 1.
          - 0 and 1 are not prime.
Only two divisors:
          - A prime number can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself.
          - Example: 5 → divisors: 1, 5
Cannot be negative:
          - Prime numbers are always positive integers.
The smallest prime number:
          - 2 is the smallest prime and the only even prime number.
Odd primes:
          - Except 2, all other prime numbers are odd.
          - Example: 3, 5, 7, 11…
Step-by-Step Logic to Check Prime Number :
Let's take an example → 29
Step 1️⃣
  - Take the number → num = 29
Step 2️⃣
  - If num <= 1 → Not prime (because prime numbers are > 1)
Step 3️⃣
  - Initialize a flag → isPrime = true (assume it’s prime)
Step 4️⃣
  - Loop from i = 2 to i <= √num
            - Why √num? → If a number has a factor greater than √num, it must also have a factor smaller than √num.
            - This makes the check faster.
Step 5️⃣
In each iteration, check:  if (num % i == 0) → num is not prime → set isPrime = false → break the loop
Step 6️⃣
After the loop, check the flag:
       - isPrime == true → ✅ Prime Number
       - isPrime == false → ❌ Not Prime


Q5. 🧮 Sieve of Eratosthenes (ए-रा-टॉस-थ-नीज़) FOR 'PRIME' NUMBER?
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an easy and fast method to find all prime numbers up to a given number n. Instead of checking each number one by one, 
we cross out (remove) all multiples of each prime number.
Example:  Find all prime numbers up to 30.
Start with numbers:  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... 30
1️⃣ First prime is 2.
          → Cross out all multiples of 2: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...
2️⃣ Next unmarked number is 3.
          → Cross out all multiples of 3: 6, 9, 12, 15, ...
3️⃣ Next is 5.
          → Cross out multiples of 5: 10, 15, 20, 25, ...
4️⃣ Continue this until √n.
          → All numbers that are not crossed out are prime numbers ✅
Step-by-Step Logic to Implement
Let’s say we want all prime numbers up to n = 30.
Step 1️⃣
       Create a boolean array isPrime[n+1] and fill all entries as true in array using (Arrays.fill(arr, true    -> built-in function).
Step 2️⃣
       Mark index[0] and index[1] as false because 0 and 1 are not prime.
Step 3️⃣
       Start from i = 2 (assume first prime number). i<=num
Step 4️⃣
      If index[i] == true, then mark all multiples of i (like i*i, i*i+i, i*i+2*i, … up to n) as false. use j = i + i (phla factor pick) ; j<=num; j= j+i;
Step 5️⃣
      After the loop ends, all indexes that are still true in the array are prime numbers. for that use loop from i=2; i<=num;


Q6. HCF / GCD — Highest Common Factor / Greatest Common Divisor ?
Defination :
- HCF or GCD means the largest same divisor of two or more numbers.that means no remainder is left.
💡 Example:  For numbers 12 and 18:
                       - The numbers that divide 12 are → 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
                       - The numbers that divide 18 are → 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
                       - 👉 Common numbers = 1, 2, 3, 6
                       - 👉 Highest common number = 6
                       - ✅ So, HCF (or GCD) of 12 and 18 is 6.
Follow-up Question :
Wrtie code for finding GCD of 24 and 36 there are two numbers?
STEPS FOR NORMAL APPROACH :
---------------------------
STEP-1:
- find Min(num1,num2) from both num. 
STEP-2:
- start loop i=1 to i<=min
STEP-3:
- check both num1 % i == 0 && num2 % i ==0 if yes then update ans=i;


Q7. 🧮 Euclidean (यूक-ली-डियन) Algorithm For FINDING 'GCD' ?
The Euclidean Algorithm is an easy way to find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers.
    - Subtract or divide the smaller number from the bigger number again and again.
    - if any number num1 or num2 becomes 0 then other number is GCD. 
Two ways to find GCD using the Euclidean Algorithm
🔸 1. Subtraction Method (old/original form)
    - Subtract the smaller number from the bigger one and other number is same repeatedly.
    - Stop if any number num1 or num2 becomes 0 then other number is GCD.
Example:
Find GCD of 60 and 48
60 − 48 = 12
48 − 12 = 36
36 − 12 = 24
24 − 12 = 12
✅ When both become 12 → GCD = 12
STEPS TO IMPLEMENT :
STEP-1 :
- take two number like num1 = 24, num2=36
STEP-2 :
- due to repeated work use loop like while( num1 !=0 && num2 !=0), here if anyone become 0 then loop will break.
STEP-3 :
- now check which one is greate if(num1 > num2 ) then do substraction from num1-num2 else vise versa
STEP-4 :
- after loop completation check (num1==0) return num2 which number is non-zero print that one.

🔸 2. Division Method (modern and faster form)
STEPS TO IMPLEMENT :
STEP-1 :
- take two number like num1 = 24, num2=36
STEP-2 :
- due to repeated work use loop like while( num1 !=0 && num2 !=0), here if anyone become 0 then loop will break.
STEP-3 :
- now check which one is greate if(num1 > num2 ) then do modulo from num1=num1%num2 else vise versa
STEP-4 :
- after loop completation check (num1==0) return num2 which number is non-zero print that one.
Example:
Find GCD of 60 and 48
1️⃣ 60 ÷ 48 → remainder 12
2️⃣ 48 ÷ 12 → remainder 0
✅ GCD = 12

Q8. LCM / Least Common Multiple (or Smallest Common Multiple)
Easy Definition:
  - 👉 Matlab do (4,6) ya zyada numbers(4,6,9..) ke aise sabse chhote number (36) ko LCM bolte hain jo sabhi numbers (4,6,9) se completely divide (exactly divide) ho jaye.
💡 Example:  For numbers 4 and 6:
                       - Multiples of 4 → 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...
                       - Multiples of 6 → 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...
                       - 👉 Common multiples = 12, 24, ...
                       - 👉 Smallest common multiple = 12
                       - ✅ So, LCM of 4 and 6 is 12.
STEPS :
      -> find GCD first,
      -> do n1 * n2 / gcd. you will find the result.

Note:- Relationships between GCD and LCM ?
GCD×LCM=Product of the numbers
🔹 Example:  Let’s take a = 12 and b = 18
GCD(12, 18) = 6
LCM(12, 18) = 36
Now check the relationship:
👉 6 × 36 = 216
👉 12 × 18 = 216 ✅


Q9. Lcm of two numbers if you already know GCD of two numbers ?
Formula :
if a and b are two numbers, then lcm =n1 * n2 / gcd.


Q10. print all unique prime factors of a number ?
Prime factor : Jo prime number ho Aur jo given number ko completely divide kare.
Example: 
Number = 60  [60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 ] but Unique prime factors:  2 3 5.
Steps :
  - Initialize an empty list
  - Iterate from i = 2 to √num
  - If num is divisible by i:
  - Add i to the list
  - Divide num by i repeatedly until not divisible
  - After loop, if num > 1, add it to list
  - Print the list



Q11. Factorial of a Number ?
  - Factorial means multiplying a number by all the whole numbers less than it down to 1.
  - It is shown using a “!” (exclamation mark).
💡 Example:
For number 5,
👉 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
More examples:
4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
1! = 1 (by rule)
0! = 1 (special rule)
💡 Rule of Factorial:  n!=n×(n−1)!
🧩 Example using the rule:
Let’s take 5!
5!=5×(5−1)!   5!=5×4!
Now, 4!=4×3×2×1=24
So, 5!=5×24=120✅
📘 Special Rules:
1! = 1
0! = 1 (by definition — special mathematical rule)


Q172. LeetCode :  Find trailing zeros in factorial of a number ?
Example :
   1. Suppose the number is '3' lets find its factors-> 3! = 3*2*1 = 6          [0]
   2. Suppose the number is '5' lets find its factors-> 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120    [1]
   3. Suppose the number is '10' lets find its factors-> 10! = 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 3628800  [2]
STEPS:
 1. int res = 0;
 2. int i = 5; while(i<=num){ res= res + num/i; i=i*5;} return res;
 3. return res;



Q13. 🧮 What is Modular Arithmetic?
Modular Arithmetic is math with remainders.
When we divide a number by another number, the remainder is the result in modular arithmetic.
We write it as:
👉 a mod m → means remainder when a is divided by m
🔹 Example:
10 mod 3 = 1
(because 10 ÷ 3 = 3 remainder 1)
15 mod 5 = 0
(because 15 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder 0)
🧩 Some Useful Rules (in easy words) :
(a + b) % m   = (a % m + b % m) % m

(a * b) % m   = (a % m * b % m) % m

(a - b) % m   = ((a % m - b % m)+m) % m

a % m = (a % m + m) % m   => handles neg
Note:- modulo limit will be given like,1000 (10^3)



Q14. Follow up Question :
without modular arithmatic ?
current time = 10 hrs
add = 5 hours
here you will find 15 but in clock 15 does not exist
so apply modular arithmatic where limit is 12 hrs.


Q15. follow-up quez : given an array use one for loop and print this array 4 times.
arr = {8,9,1,3,2};
Note:- use modular arithmatic on index .


                                                       
Q16. Write code for Fibonacci series using normal logic and recursion?
Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it, starting from 0 and 1.
Input: 
int num = 15;
output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13.
Note:- Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

Input :
int num1=1;
Output: 35

Q18. find sum of first n natural number ?
