Q1. What is Datastructure ?
A data structure is a 'simple way to keep and arrange data' in the computer so we can 'use it easily'.


                             Data Structure

                              Array       ------------------------
                                            |          |           |
                                       Linked List   Stack       Queue
Note:- All collection framework classes (List, Set, Queue, Map, etc.) can grow or shrink at runtime —So they are dynamic data structures by behavior.
# Primitive Data Structures :
                         Primitive data structures are the basic built-in data types in a programming language.
                Key Points :
                         - Stored directly in memory.
                         - Very fast to process.
                         - Hold a single value.
                         - Size is fixed.
# Non-Primitive Data Structures :
                               Non-primitive data structures are complex data types built using primitive types. They can store multiple values or objects, and can grow in size.
                     🔹 Linear :
                                Array
                                Linked List
                                Stack
                                Queue
                     🔹 Non-Linear
                                Tree
                                Graph
                     Key Points
                                Created by the programmer.
                                Slower compared to primitive.
                                Can store multiple values.
                                Size may be dynamic or flexible.
      ✅ Linear Data Structure (LDs) :  A data structure in which elements are arranged in a straight line (one after another).
      ❌ Non-Linear Data Structure (NLDs)  : A data structure where elements are not arranged in a straight line.Instead, one element can connect to many elements.


Q2. 🧩 What is an Array?
        - An array is a group of elements that are stored together in one place in memory.
        - All the elements in an array are of the same data type (like all integers or all strings).
🎯 Purpose of an Array
        - The main purpose of an array is to store many values in a single variable instead of creating many separate variables.
        - Example:
Instead of writing
int a1 = 10;
int a2 = 20;
int a3 = 30;
You can use an array:
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30};
💡 Why Arrays are Used
        - To store multiple values of the same type easily.
        - To access elements quickly using an index (like arr[0], arr[1]).
        - To save memory and reduce code length.
        - To process large data efficiently using loops.

Note:-
👉 In an array, each index is connected (mapped) to the memory address of its element.
For example, if the first element is stored at address 3000, and each element takes 4 bytes,
then the next element will be at 3004, the next at 3008, and so on.
👉 The array variable stores the memory address of the first element.
That’s why we say the array name points to the first element of the array.
Example :
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30};
If the first element 10 is stored at memory address 3000,
then:
       arr[0] → address 3000
       arr[1] → address 3004
       arr[2] → address 3008
And arr itself holds the address 3000 (the first element’s address).


Array Index to Memory Address Mapping ?
   - Formula to Find Memory Address of Any Element :
        If:
             Base_Address = address of first element (arr[0])
             i            = index of the element you want
             Size         = size of each element in bytes
       Then the memory address of arr[i] is:    Address of arr[i] = Base_Address + i × Size_of_element
       Example
Suppose:
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
Base address of arr[0] = 3000
Size of int = 4 bytes
Now, memory addresses:
| Index `i` | Element | Memory Address Calculation | Address |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------------- | ------- |
| 0         | 10      | 3000 + 0 * 4               | 3000    |
| 1         | 20      | 3000 + 1 * 4               | 3004    |
| 2         | 30      | 3000 + 2 * 4               | 3008    |
| 3         | 40      | 3000 + 3 * 4               | 3012    |
| 4         | 50      | 3000 + 4 * 4               | 3016    |


Ways to Declare an Array  ?
------------------------------
👉 Way 1: Declare and Then Initialize :
int[] arr;         // Declaration
arr = new int[5];  // Initialization with size 5

👉 Way 2: Declare and Initialize Together
int[] arr = new int[5];  // Declaration + Initialization
// Or directly with values
int[] arr2 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};  // Size is automatically 5

Note:- above line is actually a shortcut for:    int[] arr2 = new int[]{10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
compiler does it for you automatically when you use {} initialization.


Ways to Traverse on Array ?
| Method        | Syntax                              | Can use index? | Version |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| For loop      | `for (int i=0; i< arr.length; i++)` | ✅ Yes          | All     |
| For-each loop | `for (int x : arr)`                 | ❌ No           | Java 5+ |
| While loop    | `while(i < arr.length)`             | ✅ Yes          | All     |
| Do-while loop | `do { ... } while(i < arr.length);` | ✅ Yes          | All     |
| Stream API    | `Arrays.stream(arr).forEach(...)`   | ❌ No           | Java 8+ |

Note:-
Using Arrays.toString() :  Not a traversal but useful for debugging.
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));



Q1. follow up question insertion at any specific position?
    you have 7 size array having elements only 6 elements now you have to insert a particular elements at given index x ?
   input : 
       int [] arr = new int [7] ; 
        arr[0]=10;
        arr[1]=20;
        arr[2]=30;
        arr[3]=50;
        arr[4]=60;
        arr[5]=70;
int index = 3;
int elements = 40 ;
Note:- first check index is within range/valid or not


Q2. Follow up question delete element at any specific position ?
    you have 7 size array having elements 7 elements now you have to delete a particular elements at given index x ?
   input : 
       int [] arr = new int [7] ; 
        arr[0]=10;
        arr[1]=20;
        arr[2]=30;
        arr[3]=40;
        arr[4]=50;
        arr[5]=60;
        arr[6] =70;
int index = 3;
Note:- first check index is within range/valid or not

Q2.1 : Delete elements from an array at multiple given indexes ?
Input:
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70};
int[] deleteIndex = {1, 3, 4};
Output:
10 30 60 70 0 0 0
Note:- you need to mark delete index then create boolean array 



Q3. Update a specific index position value in an array
Input: 
arr = {10,20,30,40,50}
index x = 2 
newValue = 100
Output: 10,20,100,40,50


Q4. calculate the sum of all the elements in the given array?
Input:
int [] arr = {1,5,3};
Output:
9


Q5. Calculate the maximum value out of all the elements in the array?
Input:
int [] arr = {1,5,3};
Output:
5


Note:- 
arr.clone() :
         - Array ka naya object banata hai
         - Same length hoti hai
         - Index-wise values copy hoti hain
         - Original array se different reference hota hai
Arrays.copyOf(originalArray, newLength) :
            - Arrays ek class hai util package ke ander uske ander bahut sari utility method jo as helper method kam krti hai unme se ek ye v hai
            - Naya array object banata hai
            - newLength ke according size set karta hai
            - Original array ke elements index-wise copy karta hai
            - Agar newLength:
                      - chhota hai → extra elements cut ho jaate hain
                      - bada hai → extra places default values se fill hoti hain
Arrays.copyOfRange(original, from, to) :
                              - range (sub-array) nikalne ke liye use hota hai.
                              - from → starting index (inclusive)
                              - to → ending index (exclusive)


Q6. Count the number of Occurrences of a particular element x ?
Input:
int [] arr = {5,6,5,1,5};
int x = 5;
Output: 3


Q7. Count the number of elements strictly greater than value x ?

    int x = 5;
Output: 7

Q8.  check if the given array is sorted or not ?
Input :
        int [] arr = {1,3,5,5,7,9};
Output: true


Q9. Find the kth smallest element and kth largest element in the array ?
Input:
int[] arr = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15};
int k = 3;
Output:
3rd smallest = 7
3rd largest = 10
Note:- sort krenge fir k-1 for smallest and n-k for largest why n-k because 1st largest n-1, 2nd largest n-2 , third largest n-3 so n-k is kth largest.



Q10. find the total number of pairs in the array whose sum is equal to the give value x ?
Input :
int [] arr = {4,6,3,5,8,2};
int tar = 7;
ans = 2 
Note:- except brute-force use hashset for optimization.


Q11. count the numbers of tripplets whose sum is equal to given value x ?
Input :
int [] arr = {1,4,5,6,3};
int tar = 12;
ans = 2 
Note:- except brute-force , use Sorting+ two pointer.


Q12. find the unique number in the given array, where all the elements are being repeated twice with one value being unique.
     Constant : only positive elements in the array.
Input :
int [] arr = {1,2,3,4,2,1,3};
Note:- 1. use two loops,whenever i,j becomes equals then intialize with -1, again use loop jo -1 nhi hoga wo ans hoga.    2.xor operator best way


Q13. given an array 'a' consisting of integers , return the first value that is repeating in this array, if no value is being repeated return -1?
Input:
int [] arr = {1,5,3,4,6,3,4};
ans = 3;

Input :
int a = 9;
int b = 3;


Q15. reverse an array consisting of integers value?
Input:
int [] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
Output:
5,4,3,2,1
Note:- use two pointer.


Q16. rotate the given array 'a' by k steps, where k is non-negative . Constraint : k can be greater than n as well , n is nothing but array length?
Input :
int [] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
int k = 2
Output: 4,5,1,2,3
Note:- here doing k = k%n; means agr k n se bada hoga jaise k=7 and n=5 to 1 se 5 tak pe exact array apne original position me aa jayega fir wha se 2 bar rotate hoga to iske liye hee moduls kr lenge phle hee


Q17. given q queries, check if the given number is present in the array or not?
     Note:- value of all the elements in the array is less than 10 to the power 5.
Input:
int [] arr = {5,6,5,400,560,1000,400};
int q = 5;
Output:
5 -> yes,
34 -> No,
400 -> yes,
10000 -> No,
560 -> yes
Note:- use frequency array concept here.



Q18. given an integer array 'a', return the prefix sum/running sum in the same array without creating new array?
Input:
int [] arr = {2,1,3,4,5};
Output :
2 3 6 10 15


Q19. given an array of integers of size n, Answer q queries where you need to print the sum of values in a given range of indices from L to R (both included).
     Note:- the values of L and R in queries follow 1-based indexing. so 0 pe element store nhi krna hai because 1 based indexing follow krna hai.
Input:
int [] arr = {2,4,1,3,6,5};
int l = 2;
int r = 4;
Output: 8



Q20. check if we can partition the array into two subarrays with equals sum, more formally check that the prefix sum of a part of the array is equal to the 
     suffix sum of rest of the array?
Input 1 :                                                             | Input 3 :

🧩 Difference Between Size and Capacity in a Dynamic Array
Size:
→ The number of elements that are currently stored in the array.
(Example: If an array contains 5 elements, its size = 5.)
Capacity:
→ The maximum number of elements the array can hold before it needs to grow (resize).
(Example: If the array can hold up to 10 elements, its capacity = 10.)
Note:
👉 The concepts of size and capacity apply only to dynamic arrays,
because a static array has a fixed size that cannot change after creation.
