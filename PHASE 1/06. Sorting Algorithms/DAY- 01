Q1. 🧩 What is the meaning of sorted?
Sorted means arranged in a specific order either of numbers,strings,objects etc. sorted happens in two ways :
-> ascending order (smallest to largest) : 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
-> descending order ( largest to smalles ) : 8, 5, 3, 2, 1


Types of Sorting :
------------------

1. Bubble Sort :- 
👉 Compares two numbers at a time and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
It keeps doing this again and again until everything is sorted.
Example:
List: 5, 3, 2
         Compare 5 & 3 → swap → 3, 5, 2
        Compare 5 & 2 → swap → 3, 2, 5
        Compare 3 & 2 → swap → 2, 3, 5
✅ Final: 2, 3, 5
             🔹 Steps: To Implement Bubble Sort.
                                             1️⃣ Run the outer loop from 0 to n-1.  (because jab 1 element hogi adjacent ke liye or baki adjast ho chuke honge to koi sense nhi bnta usko adjust krke becoz already wo shi order me hoga.)
                                             2️⃣ Inside it, run an inner loop from 0 to n-i-1. (Each pass pushes the largest element to the end.)
                                             3️⃣ Compare adjacent elements:
                                                                    If arr[j] > arr[j+1], then swap them.
                                             4️⃣ Repeat until the entire array is sorted.
✅ Time Complexity: O(n²), Space Complexity: O(1)
