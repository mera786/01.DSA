Q14. What is Factory Design Pattern?
Factory Pattern ek Creational Design Pattern hai jo object creation logic ko hide karta hai aur client ko sirf interface deta hai.
In simple line: Object banana factory ka kaam, use karna client ka kaam.


❓ Problem Without Factory ?
Car car = new BMW();
Car car2 = new Audi();
Car car3 = new Tesla();
           ❌ Client ko har class ka naam pata hona chahiye
           ❌ Code tight coupled ho jata hai
           ❌ New car add karne pe client code change karna padega

Q15. Why use Factory pattern?
 - To decouple object creation from usage.
 - To increase flexibility and maintainability.
 - Helps follow Open/Closed Principle: new types can be added without modifying existing code.

Q16. What are types of factory pattern ?
 - Simple Factory (Not a formal GoF pattern) : Provides a method to create objects based on input.
- Factory Method : Defines an interface for creating objects, but subclasses decide the concrete class.
- Abstract Factory : Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Q17. How to implement Factory Method?
  - Define Product Interface – Shape with draw() method.
  - Create Concrete Products – Circle and Square implement Shape.
  - Create Factory Class – ShapeFactory has getShape(String type) to return objects based on input.
  - Use the Factory – In TestFactory.main(), create ShapeFactory, call getShape("CIRCLE"), and invoke draw().
✅ Key idea: Client code uses the factory to get objects without knowing the exact class.

Q18. Difference between Factory Method and Abstract Factory ?
| Factory Method                                 | Abstract Factory                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Creates **one product** at a time              | Creates **family of related products**           |
| Subclasses decide which product to instantiate | Provides an interface for multiple factories     |
| Example: ShapeFactory                          | Example: GUIFactory (WindowsFactory, MacFactory) |



FACTORY CODE :
---------------

1️⃣ Product Interface :
interface Car {
    void drive();
}


2️⃣ Concrete Classes :
class BMW implements Car {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving BMW");
    }
}

class Audi implements Car {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving Audi");
    }
}


3️⃣ Factory Class :
class CarFactory {

    public static Car getCar(String type) {

        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("BMW")) {
            return new BMW();
        } 
        else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("AUDI")) {
            return new Audi();
        }

        return null;
    }
}


4️⃣ Client Code :
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Car car1 = CarFactory.getCar("BMW");
        car1.drive();

        Car car2 = CarFactory.getCar("AUDI");
        car2.drive();
    }
}
