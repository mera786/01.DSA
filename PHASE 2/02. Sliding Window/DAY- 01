Q1.  What is Sliding Window Technique ?
⭐ Sliding Window Technique :
Sliding Window is a technique used to solve differents types of problems by using a small window (range) that moves (slides) from left to right (in general).
Instead of checking all possible subarrays (which is slow), we create a window and:
         - Expand the window by moving the right pointer.
         - Shrink the window by moving the left pointer.
         - Keep track of something inside the window (sum, max, unique elements, etc.)
This helps convert O(n²) brute-force loops into O(n) efficient solutions.
⭐ When to Use Sliding Window?
Use it when the problem involves:
✔ Subarrays
✔ Substrings
✔ Consecutive elements
✔ Fixed size or variable-size ranges
✔ Conditions like: “longest”, “smallest”, “maximum sum”, “length”, “at most K distinct elements”

⭐ There are two types of sliding windows :
    - fixed size : here we are talking about fixed size window like k=3 means window length is 3;
    - variable size: variable size works into two phase :
                                                      - expansion phase (badhna) :- adding into the window.
                                                      - shrinking phase (sheekudna) :- deleting from window.

⭐ How to solve any sliding window problem ?
STEPS for fixed size:
1.  intialize the window (k=3) so first calculate sum of three elements.
2.  solve for other elements
3.  calculate your answer (like, max, sumofsubarray,logestsubstringlength)
STEPS for variable size:
1.  directly goes to loop
2.  calculate your answer (like, max, sumofsubarray,logestsubstringlength)

⭐ Difference between Sliding window and two-pointer ?
| Technique      | Movement                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Sliding Window | left++, right++ (forward only)   |
| Two Pointers   | left++, right-- (from both ends) |


Q. follow up : given an array find conquitive elements maxSum  and also elements which dominating for maxsum like, 8,10,12 for this array?
Step 1: Define Input :
             int[] arr = {7, 1, 8, 10, 12, 0, 5};
             int k = 3;   // where k = window size (subarray length).
Step 2: Calculate Initial Window Sum :
                        int windowSum = 0;
                         for(int i = 0; i < k; i++){
                             windowSum += arr[i];
                          }
Step 3: Initialize Max Sum :
                     int maxSum = windowSum;
Step 4: Slide the Window  :
                         newWindowSum = oldWindowSum 
                                                 - elementGoingOut 
                                                 + elementComingIn
                        for(int start = 1; start < n - k + 1; start++){
                         windowSum = windowSum - arr[start - 1] + arr[start + k - 1];
                         maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
                        }
Step 5: Print Result :
                    System.out.println(maxSum);
